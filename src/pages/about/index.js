              I began my professional life in university. Initially, I gained experience in the
              accounting and finance sector, then took on broader responsibilities as a manager. I
              specialized in operational management and effectively directed relations with official
              institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To boost productivity, I optimized workflows and reduced costs by efficiently using
              resources. I digitalized processes and gained valuable experiences by managing this
              transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              By strengthening supplier relations, I achieved cost advantages and operational
              efficiency. Together with the team, we initiated efforts to boost employee motivation,
              which contributed to speeding up processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these experiences played a role in supporting organizations to operate
              seamlessly, efficiently, and harmoniously.

              In 2022, I transitioned into the software industry as a full-time frontend developer.
              <br />
              This was not only an opportunity to improve my technical skills but also a key
              milestone that deepened my perspective on product management.
            </p>
            <p>As a frontend developer:</p>

            <p>At the same time:</p>

              <li>I acted as a bridge between product and development teams</li>

                Participated in client meetings, analyzed needs, and translated them for the tech

              <li>Contributed to roadmap planning and took an active role in sprint execution</li>

              This period allowed me to build a multi-layered connection between code, users, and

              Returning to Product: A Conscious Decision

            <p>
              While working as a developer, I experienced the satisfaction of contributing to
              technical systems and building real features. <br /> But over time, I realized my true
              motivation came from transforming ideas into strategy, solving user problems, and
              aligning teams around shared product goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Writing code was valuable, but I&apos;ve always been someone who asks not just how
              something should be done, but why it should be done. <br /> That&apos;s why I returned
              to product management—a space where I could think more broadly and drive impact at a
              higher level.
            </p>
            <p>
              My development experience sharpened my ability to evaluate technical feasibility in
              product decisions. <br /> Today, I operate as a product manager who understands both
              strategic and technical layers—helping teams reach the right solutions faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              After transitioning from frontend development, I found my true passion in product
              management. <br /> While frontend development sharpened my technical skills, it was
              the strategic side of product development—solving real user problems, aligning teams,
              and driving impactful outcomes—that truly captivated me.
            </p>
            <p>
              This shift wasn&apos;t just a career move; it was a conscious decision to bring
              together my technical background and passion for creating meaningful, user-centered
              products.
